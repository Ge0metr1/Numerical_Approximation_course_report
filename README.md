# Numerical Approximation Course Project

This repository contains MATLAB programs developed for the Numerical Approximation
course project. The codes implement several fundamental numerical methods related to
**Runge Phenomenon**, **Interpolation**, **Data Fitting**, and **Root Finding**, aiming to illustrate 
their principles and approximation characteristics.
